**Fig1_FC.png:** Functional connectivity (FC) estimation. (A) Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) across 360 by 360 regions (regional parcellation as in Glasser et al., 2016), ordered per the CA partition, adjusted by resting-state preferences (see Materials and Methods) (color-coded along each matrix edge as in D). Values are discovery-set grand averages. (B) Task-state functional connectivity (tFC) across 360 by 360 brain regions, ordered and estimated as in A (grand averages: n=50 and 64 C-PRO task states). (C) Difference matrix: [tFC – rsFC]. (D) Cortical schematic of the Cole-Anticevic (CA) intrinsic network partition (Spronk et al., 2018), empirically adjusted by the resting-state preferences of the present participants (see Materials and Methods). LH = left hemisphere; RH = right hemisphere. Color-coding scheme of networks and acronyms listed in parentheses are used consistently throughout the present paper.
