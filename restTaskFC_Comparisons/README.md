## Rest-to-Task Comparisons
**Purpose**: compare resting state and task state FC estimates; uses nonparametric permutation testing as well as the Mantel test

**Directory**: Contains demo code for assessing rest-to-task changes in FC; e.g., descriptive analyses of changes to FC architecture between resting state and task-evoked state(s); as opposed to mechanistic and/or functional analyses (see below)

## Files
**restFC.m**: a MATLAB function for computing resting-state functional connectivity with Pearson's correlation coefficient; instructions in script comments  
- example files (n=2 for GitHub file size limits): firRestData.mat  

**taskFC.m**: a MATLAB function for computing task-state functional connectivity with Pearson's correlation coefficient; instructions in script comments
- example files (n=2 for GitHub file size limits): firTaskData.mat, firTaskDesign.mat

**visualizeFC.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook demo code for visualizing functional connectivity matrices ordered according to the Cole-Anticevic partition (adjusted by empirical resting-state data)
- example files (data files have n=2 for GitHub file size limits; other files explained in notebook): restData.mat, taskData.mat, nodeOrderPyVer.mat, nodeIndicesPyVer.mat, nodeOrder.mat, boundariesPyVer.mat, colorList.txt, colorMapNets.mat, netNames.mat, netAssign.mat
