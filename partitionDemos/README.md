## Network Partition 
**Purpose**: input interregional functional connectivity estimates for rest and task, and obtain the empirically-adjusted Cole-Anticevic partition

**Directory**: Contains demo code for implementing the Cole-Anticevic (CA) network partition to organize functional connectivity (FC) estimates (e.g., adjacency matrices) into a network community structure. Also contains demo code for assessing empirical resting-state reassignments in relation to the CA partition and applying this empirically adjusted partition to task-evoked FC data (and to be used for analyses represented in the following directories)
